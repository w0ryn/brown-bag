# Brown-Bag

This is a compilation of hackathon / interview style questions and problems.
At the root of each directory, I include a markdown file which describes the problem.
Subsequent, language-specific directories contain minimum test cases and my personal implementations of solutions.

Problems often include a time-limit guideline.
The initial challenge is to pass all minimum test cases within the time-limit; however, my posted solutions are often refined beyond the initial time-constraint.

If I have multiple working solutions to a problem, I will comment in their respective asymptotic running-time.
